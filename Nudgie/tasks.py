from celery import shared_task

# for app.autodiscover_tasks() to work, you need to define a tasks.py file in each app. 
# that's why this file is here.
# in larger projects, you might have multiple apps, each with their own tasks.py file, each
# of which defines celery tasks.

# shared_task is different from app.task in that it doesn't require a celery app to be defined.
# this is so that it can be used in other apps. The thing is, reusable apps cannot depend
# on the project itself. So you can't import the celery app from the project.
